0-malloc_checked.c:
This file contains a function that allocates memory using malloc. It checks if the allocation is successful and handles any errors accordingly.

1-string_nconcat.c:
In this file, you'll find a function that concatenates two strings and returns a newly allocated string. The function handles different cases, such as empty strings or limited concatenation based on a specified number of bytes.

2-calloc.c:
Here, a function is implemented that allocates memory for an array using malloc. It utilizes the calloc approach to allocate memory and initializes the allocated memory to zero.

3-array_range.c:
The file contains a function that creates an array of integers. The function takes a minimum and maximum value and creates an array containing all values from the minimum to the maximum, inclusive. The array is ordered from the minimum to the maximum value.

100-realloc.c:
In this file, you'll find a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free. It takes a pointer to a previously allocated memory block, along with the old and new sizes. The function copies the contents from the old memory block to the newly allocated space, considering different scenarios and returning the appropriate results.

101-mul.c:
This file implements a program that multiplies two positive numbers. It takes two command-line arguments, validates them, performs the multiplication, and outputs the result. The program also handles different error cases, such as incorrect argument count or non-digit arguments.
