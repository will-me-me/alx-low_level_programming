    The file "1-strncat.c" concatenates two strings, but it limits the number of bytes to be used fro	m the source string. If the source string contains equal to or more than 'n' bytes, it does not need to be null-terminated.

    The file "2-strncpy.c" copies a string.

    The file "3-strcmp.c" compares two strings.

    The file "4-rev_array.c" reverses the content of an array of integers.

    The file "6-cap_string.c" contains a function that capitalizes all words in a string.

    The file "7-leet.c" contains a function that encodes a string into 1337.

    The file "100-rot13.c" contains a function that encodes a string using the rot13 algorithm.

    The file "101-print_number.c" is responsible for writing a function that prints an integer.
