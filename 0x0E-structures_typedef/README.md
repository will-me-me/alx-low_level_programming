C - Structures, typedef
Dog Project

This repository contains a set of C source files and a header file that together form the "Dog Project." The project includes functions to work with a dog data structure, represented by the struct dog. It also defines a type alias dog_t using a typedef declaration.
Files

    dog.h: This is the header file that contains the struct dog definition, the typedef for dog_t, and function prototypes for all the functions used in the project.

    1-init_dog.c: This source file implements the init_dog function, which initializes a variable of type struct dog with given values for name, age, and owner.

    2-print_dog.c: This source file contains the print_dog function, which prints the details of a struct dog.

    4-new_dog.c: This source file implements the new_dog function, which creates a new dynamically allocated struct dog with given values for name, age, and owner.

    5-free_dog.c: This source file contains the free_dog function, which frees the memory allocated for a struct dog created using new_dog.
